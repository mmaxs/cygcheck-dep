Subject: [ANNOUNCEMENT] cygcheck-dep-3.0-2

Version 3.0-2 of cygcheck-dep has been uploaded.

cygcheck-dep is a bash script for displaying information on dependencies
for installed Cygwin packages. For example: the information about package
leaves; packages with broken dependencies; obsolete, and orphaned packages;
particular package's dependencies; unused dependencies that can be removed
along with particular package meant for uninstalling. See --help for more
description.

It can be useful if you are using some Cygwin software, and want to
keep the Cygwin installation directory clean from unused packages.


Changelog since version 2.1-1:
  * the script is almost completely rewritten to reflect the changes
    in setup.exe functioning and for clean code;
  * the legacy code for support of Cygwin Ports collection is dropped;
  * there are new command options.
